# CelestePlugin
 
Celeste-like parkour plugin developed for the MC Wipeout event.


HOW TO USE:
Select a region using /parkourregion <1-5>. You can then place your blocks (defaults are aqua/red concrete).
Modify the block switch interval using /parkourinterval <ticks> and the block switch warning using /parkourwarndelay <ticks>.
Start/stop the block switching by using /parkourenable and /parkourdisable.
Make sure that when destroying/placing blocks a message confirming it appears in your actionbar, otherwise your permissionsare set up incorrectly or you do not have a region selected.
Deselect a region using /parkourregion 0 or switch to another one.

Full notes & instructions are in the config.yml file.
